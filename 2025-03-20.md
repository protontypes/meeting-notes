### Agenda and Notes
- [x] Check-in
    - [x] Added notes from last week https://github.com/protontypes/meeting-notes
- [x] GitHub and climate triage
    - Tobi in Lead
    - Relaunch climate triage, update logos with companies and people involved in the relaunch
    - Adding additional Analytics
        - should cover how many issues are closed and how many are closed (e.g. per month)
        - Excerpt from Tobis mail to michael (from github)
```
Here some more ideas how to increase and measure impact: 
1. We should motivate the open source community in this area to add Good First Issue labels to their issues.
2. We should use a consistent hashtag in our post and motivate people to use the hashtag if they talk about the project or closed an issue. The hashtag could be measured across GitHub but also social media platforms. We could use #climatetriage but also some other GitHub hashtag. 
3. I will write a blog post draft for OpenSource.org that we can sign and share together. OpenSource.org helped a lot in the past in doing marketing for the project.
4. We should try to motivate some Open Source "Influence" people to share our content. 
5. We should set up a chat room or something similar where we guide people and match them according to their skills to some open source project. The OpenSustain.tech community can help this people to find good project to participate.

        - We should be aware of the signaling of the names
    - OST projects are 90% for developers, and ~10% with a nice frontend which also ca
    - We can not show historical data/data growth at the moment because we do not have any historical data
