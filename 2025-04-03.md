Last weeks notes https://github.com/protontypes/meeting-notes/blob/main/2025-03-20.md

We talked about GitHub a lot and the pros and cons of working with them. 
They could have done worse with the platform, and they've got 1/2 million followers on youtube. OST's best video has only 1.1k views

### ML Semantic Searching
- Andrew will be the lead for some OS Machine learning 
- Also doing work ai generated keyword generation for open source projects.
- Talked about filtering for relevance or semantic search or, primitive document frequency, or word frequency.

### Climate Triage Slide or Homepage
- Pierre tentatively agreed to make a slide or webpage for Climate Triage better than the home page.
- WE all agree it's too much work to change the page but 
- we should have one image to explain what it Climate Triage is. 
- Tobi said we should change the text. Maybe put a link or a landing page. 
- Pierre wrote "URL : https://climatetriage.com/about

Pierre's Pitch for climate triage
_Do you want to contribute to open-source tools within climate technology and sustainability?
You have landed in the right place. ClimateTriage helps you find open-source projects that need contributions aligned with your skills and possibilities.
How to get started?
Go to the listing [link to https://climatetriage.com/ ]. We have gathered a listing of good first contribution opportunities among all issues of relevant projects to help you get started.
Do you have a value-aligned project that needs contributions?
You can add your project in the listing of open source project of OpenSustain.tech [link to https://github.com/protontypes/open-sustainable-technology ], which will allow your project to be part of the listing._

### Digital Public Good Alliance - workshop
- Tobi talked about a group in Nigeria that has access to a lot of UN or government data on open source projects.
- [Digital Public Good Alliance](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are)
- They're independent. They need help with the digital part. Searching etc.  Bolaji Ayodeji. Very good network. Huge. 
- "Bolaji Ayodeji thanked the recipient for the meeting, shared relevant resources, invited further project suggestions for DPG certification, and proposed a follow-up call with his team to explore collaboration and climate-focused opportunities."
