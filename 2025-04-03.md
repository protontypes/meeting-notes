Last weeks notes https://github.com/protontypes/meeting-notes/blob/main/2025-03-20.md

We talked about GitHub a lot and the pros and cons of working with them. 
They could have done worse with the platform, and they've got 1/2 million followers on youtube. OST's best video has only 1.1k views

Andrew will be the lead for some climate... tech thing. Machine learning. 
Also doing work ai generated keyword generation for open source projects.
Talked about filtering for relevance or semantic search or, primitive document frequency, or word frequency.

### Climate Triage Slide or Homepage
- Pierre tentatively agreed to make a slide or webpage for Climate Triage better than the home page.
- WE all agree it's too much work to change the page but 
- we should have one image to explain what it Climate Triage is. 
- Tobi said we should change the text. Maybe put a link or a landing page. 

### Digital Public Good Alliance - workshop
- Tobi talked about a group in Nigeria that has access to a lot of UN or government data on open source projects.
- [Digital Public Good Alliance](https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/who-we-are)
- They're independent. They need help with the digital part. Searching etc.  Bolaji Ayodeji. Very good network. Huge. 
- "Bolaji Ayodeji thanked the recipient for the meeting, shared relevant resources, invited further project suggestions for DPG certification, and proposed a follow-up call with his team to explore collaboration and climate-focused opportunities."
